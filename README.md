# Predicting-When-Countries-Go-Green
This project forecasts when countries are likely to achieve a sustainable electricity mix by calculating the Green Electricity Index (GEI). Using ML and time-series data, it predicts future GEI levels and identifies clusters of countries based on transition trends. The goal is to assess global progress toward clean electricity by 2030 and beyond.
